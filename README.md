# Power-Bi-Project-
This project analyzes telecom customer churn to identify key drivers such as contract type, internet service, tenure, and billing methods. Interactive Power BI dashboards were built to visualize churn patterns, high-risk segments, and revenue impact. The insights help support data-driven strategies to improve customer retention and reduce churn.
